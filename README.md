# Remote Neovim using SSH

**remote-nvim-ssh.nvim** enables Neovim to be used for remote development using SSH. 

It aims to bring near feature-parity with [Remote development using SSH - VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh). Author intends to extend this to `docker` containers in future, but that is out of scope right now.

ðŸš§ This plugin is under active development and is not yet ready for use.  ðŸš§

## Prerequisites

* Neovim >= 0.8.0
